# pynput-keyboard-shortcuts
Allows you to set OS-wide keyboard shortcuts for your python methods (originally made for [this project](https://github.com/platelminto/spotify-helper), but it seemed generally useful so here it is as a standalone thing). As it works with pynput, it's crossplatform compatible, but requires sudo on macOS.
